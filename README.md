## 1. Project Overview

Syncro is a dual-role marketplace platform that implements a Reverse Auction model.  
Instead of sellers listing products and waiting for buyers, clients post Requests for Proposals (RFPs) describing their needs. Sellers receive notifications based on their niche and submit competitive bids.

The system reduces buyer search cost and helps sellers reach high-intent customers efficiently.

## 2. Problem Statement

In traditional e-commerce:
- Buyers waste time searching across multiple platforms.
- Sellers spend money on passive marketing.
- No unified system allows real-time competitive responses to buyer needs.

Syncro bridges this discovery gap.
